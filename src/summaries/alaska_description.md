# Summary for alaska

The analysis of Alaska's government employment and pay data from 2003 to 2022 reveals notable trends across high-employment functions, particularly in elementary and secondary education, as well as higher education. Over the entire period, elementary and secondary education employment showed relative stability, with minor fluctuations. However, pay in this sector increased steadily, reflecting a general rise in compensation levels. In the most recent years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, employment remained largely unchanged, but pay saw a moderate increase, indicating a focus on maintaining competitive salaries despite stable employment figures.

In higher education, there was a clear upward trend in both employment and pay from 2003 to 2022. Employment in this sector grew significantly, with a notable increase in full-time positions over the medium-term period (around 8â€“10 years back). Pay also rose consistently, with a marked increase in compensation per employee. During the pandemic years, higher education maintained its employment levels while continuing to increase pay, highlighting a sustained investment in this sector despite broader economic challenges.

Overall, the data indicates that while employment numbers in these high-employment government functions have shown stability or moderate growth, pay has consistently increased, reflecting a broader trend of rising compensation in Alaska's government sectors. This trend is particularly pronounced in higher education, where both employment and pay have seen significant long-term growth.
