# Summary for indiana

Corrections employment in Indiana has experienced a significant decline from 2003 to 2022, with a reduction of about 37% over the entire period. The most notable drop occurred in the last few years, including the COVID-19 pandemic, where employment fell by approximately 10% from 2019 to 2022. Despite this decrease in employment, pay has steadily increased, showing a rise of roughly 10% during the pandemic years and about 7% over the full period. This trend indicates an increase in per-capita pay as overall employment numbers decreased.

Pay in this sector has shown substantial growth, increasing by around 87% over the full timeframe and about 2% from 2019 to 2022. This suggests a consistent upward trend in compensation alongside moderate employment growth.

The "total - all government employment" category reflects a more stable pattern with slight fluctuations over time. Employment decreased by about 3% from 2003 to 2022, with a notable decline of roughly 3% during the pandemic years (2019–2022). However, total pay increased significantly by approximately 65% over the entire period and about 7% during the pandemic years. This indicates rising costs per worker across government functions despite relatively stable employment levels.
