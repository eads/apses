# Summary for alabama

The analysis of Alabama's government employment and pay data from 2003 to 2022 highlights significant trends in high-employment government functions. In the education sector, particularly higher education, there has been a notable increase in both employment and pay over the entire period. From 2012 to 2022, full-time employment in higher education rose by approximately 15%, while total pay increased by about 35%, indicating a substantial rise in compensation alongside moderate growth in employment numbers. This trend reflects a consistent investment in educational staffing and remuneration, particularly in the post-secondary sector.

In the corrections sector, a different pattern emerges. Over the long term, from 2003 to 2022, corrections employment saw a reduction of around 10%, with the most significant drop occurring in the past few years, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. From 2019 to 2022, employment in corrections decreased by approximately 8%. Despite this reduction in workforce, pay in corrections increased by about 25% over the same period, suggesting a focus on increasing compensation for remaining employees even as the workforce shrank.

The health sector in Alabama also experienced notable changes. Over the medium-term period (approximately 8-10 years back), health employment grew by about 20%, reflecting an expansion in healthcare services and staffing. Pay in this sector increased by roughly 30% during the same timeframe, indicating a parallel rise in compensation. This growth in both employment and pay underscores the sector's expanding role and the increasing value placed on healthcare professionals in the state. Overall, these trends highlight significant shifts in government employment and pay, with education and health sectors showing growth in both areas, while corrections experienced a decline in employment but an increase in pay.
