# Summary for vermont

Corrections employment in Vermont has experienced a significant decline over the past two decades, with a 12% decrease from 2019 to 2022 alone. This recent drop is part of a broader trend, as employment in this sector has fallen by approximately 12% since 2003. Despite the decrease in staffing, pay per capita has increased significantly, with a 9% rise from 2019 to 2022 and an overall increase of about 64% since 2003. This indicates that while fewer employees are working in corrections, their compensation has grown substantially.

In higher education instructional roles, employment decreased by roughly 31% from its peak in 2009 to 2022. Pay for these roles, however, has seen a steady increase, rising by about 9% from 2019 to 2022 and approximately 31% over the entire period from 2003 to 2022. This suggests that although there are fewer instructional staff members, their average pay has continued to grow consistently over time.

The total government employment function shows a more stable trend compared to specific sectors like corrections and higher education. From 2003 to 2022, total government employment decreased slightly by about 0.2%, while pay increased by approximately 76%. In the last few years (2019–2022), total employment fell by around 3%, but pay rose by about 6%. This indicates a general trend of increasing compensation despite slight reductions in overall staffing levels across all government functions.
