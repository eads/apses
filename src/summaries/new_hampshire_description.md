# Summary for new

Corrections employment has experienced a significant decrease over the years, with a 37% reduction from 2003 to 2022. The most notable drop occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a 9% decline from 2019 to 2022. Despite the reduction in staff, pay per employee has increased substantially, up by 47% over the entire period and by 11% in just the past few years. This indicates rising compensation costs even as employment numbers fall.

In higher education instructional roles, employment rose by about 8% from 2003 to 2022, with a peak around 2018 before declining slightly in recent years. Pay for these roles saw a more dramatic increase of approximately 106% over the full period, although there was a slight dip of about 5% from its peak in 2019 to 2022. This suggests that while employment has remained relatively stable, compensation for instructional roles has increased significantly.

The "total - all government employment" category shows a more modest change overall, with employment decreasing by about 16% from 2003 to 2022. However, pay across all government functions grew by approximately 51% during this period. In recent years, from 2019 to 2022, total government employment decreased by about 3%, while pay increased by around 2%. This indicates a trend toward higher pay per employee across government functions despite shrinking workforce numbers.
