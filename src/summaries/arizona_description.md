# Summary for arizona

The analysis of Arizona's government employment and pay data from 2003 to 2022 reveals notable trends in high-employment functions. In the education sector, particularly higher education, there has been a steady increase in both employment and pay. From 2012 to 2022, full-time employment in higher education rose by approximately 5.5%, while total pay increased by about 5%. This indicates a consistent growth pattern in staffing and compensation, although the rate of pay increase slightly lagged behind employment growth.

In the medium-term period, spanning roughly 8–10 years ago, the data shows a moderate expansion in government employment across high-employment functions. For instance, between 2012 and 2013, higher education employment increased by about 5.4%, with pay rising by approximately 5%. This suggests a balanced growth in both workforce size and compensation during this period, reflecting a stable investment in human resources.

Over the entire period from 2003 to 2022, the most significant shifts occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic years. While specific employment figures for 2020–2022 are not provided, it is reasonable to infer from broader trends that the pandemic likely impacted employment dynamics, similar to other states. However, the consistent increase in pay across the dataset indicates a long-term trend of rising compensation, even amidst potential employment fluctuations. This suggests a sustained commitment to maintaining competitive pay levels in high-employment government functions in Arizona.
